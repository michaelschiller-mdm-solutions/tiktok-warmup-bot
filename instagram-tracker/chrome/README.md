# Instagram Follow/Unfollow Chrome Extension

A sophisticated Chrome extension that automates Instagram follow/unfollow operations with advanced anti-detection capabilities. Designed to work seamlessly with anti-detect browsers and implement human-like behavior patterns to avoid Instagram's bot detection systems.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Advanced Anti-Detection
- **Human-like Typing**: Variable typing speeds (80-200ms per character) with realistic typos and corrections
- **Natural Mouse Movements**: Curved paths with micro-jitter, detour routes, and unpredictable behavior
- **Contextual Browsing**: Profile viewing, scrolling, and content interaction before following
- **Intelligent Timing**: Random delays, mandatory breaks, and natural activity distribution
- **Rate Limit Compliance**: Respects Instagram's 2025 daily/hourly limits with exponential backoff

### ðŸ“Š Queue Management
- **CSV/TXT File Upload**: Bulk import of usernames with drag-and-drop support
- **Dual Queue System**: Separate follow and unfollow queues with intelligent prioritization
- **Progressive Daily Limits**: Configurable limits that can increase over time
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Smart unfollow scheduling after configurable delays

### ðŸŽ¯ Safety Features
- **Daily Limit Enforcement**: Conservative defaults (100 follows/day for new accounts)
- **Rate Limit Detection**: Automatic detection and response to Instagram blocks
- **Error Recovery**: Exponential backoff retry logic with intelligent failure handling
- **Emergency Stop**: Instant automation halt with one-click stop button

### ðŸ“ˆ Analytics & Monitoring
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live progress tracking and status monitoring

## Architecture

### Extension Components
- **Content Script**: Injected into Instagram pages for DOM manipulation
- **Background Service Worker**: Manages extension lifecycle and storage
- **Popup Interface**: Quick access controls and status monitoring
- **Sidebar UI**: Comprehensive interface overlaid on Instagram

### Core Modules
- **HumanBehaviorSimulator**: Realistic typing and mouse movement
- **InstagramInterface**: DOM interaction and element detection
- **AutomationEngine**: Orchestrates all automation operations
- **QueueManager**: Handles follow/unfollow queue processing

## Safety Guidelines

### Account Safety
1. **Start Slowly**: Begin with very conservative limits
2. **Monitor Closely**: Watch for any signs of detection or blocks
3. **Use Breaks**: Take regular breaks and avoid 24/7 operation
4. **Vary Patterns**: Don't follow predictable schedules
5. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on targeted, relevant accounts

### Risk Mitigation
- **Test Accounts**: Use test accounts before main accounts
- **Backup Strategy**: Have multiple accounts and don't rely on one
- **Stay Updated**: Keep extension updated with latest anti-detection methods
- **Follow ToS**: Respect Instagram's Terms of Service
- **Professional Use**: Consider this for legitimate business growth only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist"
This is the most common error and occurs when extension components can't communicate.

**Quick Fixes:**
1. **Refresh Instagram page** - Most common solution
2. **Wait 5-10 seconds** - Extension may still be loading
3. **Check extension is enabled** - Go to `chrome://extensions/`

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Instagram Follow/Unfollow Automation"
3. Ensure it's enabled (toggle should be blue)
4. Click "Reload" if you see any errors
5. Refresh Instagram page completely (Ctrl+F5)
6. Wait for page to fully load before trying automation

**Test Extension Status:**
Open browser console (F12) on Instagram and run:
```javascript
// Test background script
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({type: 'PING'}, (response) => {
  console.log('Background script:', response ? 'Working âœ“' : 'Not responding âœ—');
});

// Test content script
console.log('Content script:', window.instagramAutomationContentScript ? 'Loaded âœ“' : 'Not loaded âœ—');
```

#### Extension Not Loading
- Check if developer mode is enabled
- Verify all files are present in the chrome directory
- Check browser console for error messages
- Try reloading the extension

#### Automation Not Starting
- Ensure you're on Instagram.com
- Check if content script is injected (sidebar should appear)
- Verify account queue has usernames loaded
- Check daily limits haven't been reached

#### Rate Limiting Detected
- Wait for the cooldown period to complete
- Reduce daily limits and increase delays
- Check if account has been temporarily restricted
- Consider taking a longer break (24-48 hours)

#### Selectors Not Working
- Instagram frequently updates their interface
- Check browser console for selector errors
- Update selectors in `instagram-interface.js`
- Report issues for updates

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode by opening browser console on Instagram:
```javascript
// Show automation cursor
document.getElementById('automation-cursor').style.display = 'block';

// Enable verbose logging
localStorage.setItem('automation-debug', 'true');
```

### Latest Fixes Applied (January 2025)

#### Issues Fixed:
1. **"setState is not a function" error** - Added missing methods to AutomationEngine
2. **Search button not found** - Implemented direct profile navigation (more reliable)
3. **Connection establishment failures** - Enhanced message handling and validation
4. **Content script initialization issues** - Fixed incomplete initialization

#### New Features:
- **Direct Profile Navigation**: Bypasses search, goes directly to `instagram.com/username/`
- **Comprehensive Debug Tools**: Run `debug-extension.js` in console for full diagnostics
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Better Fallback Methods**: Multiple approaches when primary methods fail

#### Testing the Fixes:
1. Load the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Go to Instagram and open browser console (F12)
3. Copy and paste the contents of `debug-extension.js` into console
4. Run comprehensive tests to verify all components work
5. Test follow/unfollow with a known username like "instagram"

#### If Still Having Issues:
- Check `EXTENSION_FIXES_APPLIED.md` for detailed solutions
- Run individual debug tests to identify specific problems
- Ensure you're using the latest version with all fixes applied
