# Safe Server Startup Fix

## Problem

The backend server was failing to start because the WarmupQueueService initialization was blocking the Express server startup. This caused:

- Frontend unable to connect to backend API (ECONNREFUSED errors)
- Server hanging during startup
- Missing methods in WarmupQueueService causing crashes

## Solution

Implemented a safe startup sequence that prioritizes the Express server:

### 1. Server Startup Order Changed

- **Before**: Warmup queue started synchronously, blocking Express server
- **After**: Express server starts first, warmup queue initializes asynchronously

### 2. Timeout Protection

- Added 10-second timeout for warmup queue initialization
- Server continues running even if warmup queue fails to start
- Prevents hanging during startup

### 3. Missing Methods Implemented

Added safe implementations for missing WarmupQueueService methods:

- `cleanupOrphanedProcesses()` - Resets stuck processes from previous runs
- `detectAndResetStuckProcesses()` - Handles processes running too long
- `isAnyAccountInProgress()` - Checks for active processes
- `getValidatedReadyAccounts()` - Gets accounts ready for processing
- `processAccountPhase()` - Processes individual account phases

### 4. Error Handling

- Graceful error handling in all warmup queue operations
- Server continues running even if warmup queue encounters errors
- Proper cleanup on shutdown

## Key Changes Made

### `src/index.ts`

- Moved Express server startup before warmup queue initialization
- Added `initializeWarmupQueue()` function with timeout protection
- Server starts immediately, warmup queue starts asynchronously

### `src/services/WarmupQueueService.ts`

- Added timeout protection to `start()` method
- Implemented all missing methods with safe database operations
- Added proper error handling throughout

## Testing

Use `safe-startup-test.js` to verify the server starts correctly:

```bash
node safe-startup-test.js
```

## Result

- ✅ Express server starts immediately on port 3001
- ✅ Frontend can connect to backend API
- ✅ Warmup queue initializes safely in background
- ✅ Server remains stable even if warmup queue has issues

The server now prioritizes frontend connectivity over automation features, ensuring the core application remains functional.
