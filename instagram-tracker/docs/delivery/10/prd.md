# PBI-10: Basic Analytics and Monitoring System

## Overview

This PBI implements a basic analytics and monitoring system that provides campaign managers with essential insights into account performance, system health, and operational metrics. The focus is on delivering immediate value with simple, actionable dashboards that can be enhanced later as the platform matures.

## Problem Statement

Without visibility into system performance and account health, campaign managers operate blindly. They need basic insights to:

- Monitor account progression through warmup phases
- Identify bottlenecks in the automation pipeline
- Track overall system health and performance
- Make data-driven decisions about campaign optimization
- Spot issues before they become critical problems

## User Stories

**Primary Story**: As a campaign manager, I want basic analytics and monitoring so that I can track account performance and system health.

**Supporting Stories**:
- As a campaign manager, I want to see account status distribution so that I can understand pipeline health
- As a campaign manager, I want to monitor warmup progression so that I can identify accounts that need attention
- As a campaign manager, I want system performance metrics so that I can ensure the platform is running smoothly
- As a campaign manager, I want basic charts and statistics so that I can make informed decisions

## Technical Approach

### Dashboard Architecture
- **Overview Dashboard**: High-level system health and account statistics
- **Account Analytics**: Detailed account performance and progression tracking
- **System Monitoring**: Infrastructure health, bot performance, error rates

### Data Aggregation
- **Real-time metrics**: Current account statuses, active operations
- **Historical trends**: Daily/weekly progression, success rates over time
- **Performance indicators**: Processing speeds, error rates, completion times

### Backend Services
- **AnalyticsService**: Calculate and serve analytics data
- **MetricsCollectionService**: Gather system and account metrics
- **ReportingService**: Generate summary reports and trends

### Frontend Components
- **AnalyticsDashboard**: Main analytics overview page
- **StatusCards**: Quick metric cards for key indicators
- **SimpleCharts**: Basic charts for trends and distributions
- **HealthIndicators**: System status and alert components

## UX/UI Considerations

### Dashboard Layout
- Clean, uncluttered design focusing on key metrics
- Card-based layout for easy scanning
- Color-coded status indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Responsive design for mobile monitoring

### Key Metrics Display
- Large, easily readable numbers for important KPIs
- Trend indicators (up/down arrows) for changes
- Simple progress bars for completion percentages
- Quick filters for time ranges and account types

### Chart Implementation
- Simple bar charts for account status distribution
- Line charts for progression trends over time
- Pie charts for failure type breakdowns
- Basic table views for detailed data

## Acceptance Criteria

### Overview Dashboard
- ✅ Total account count with status breakdown
- ✅ Accounts in each warmup phase
- ✅ Success rate for completed warmups
- ✅ Accounts requiring review
- ✅ System uptime and health status

### Account Analytics
- ✅ Account progression through warmup phases
- ✅ Average time spent in each phase
- ✅ Success/failure rates by phase
- ✅ Most common failure reasons
- ✅ Account performance trends

### System Monitoring
- ✅ Bot operation success rates
- ✅ API response times and error rates
- ✅ Database health indicators
- ✅ Recent system events and alerts
- ✅ Resource usage basic metrics

### Visual Reporting
- ✅ Simple charts for key metrics
- ✅ Export basic reports to CSV
- ✅ Refresh data without page reload
- ✅ Mobile-friendly responsive design

### Performance
- ✅ Dashboard loads in under 3 seconds
- ✅ Data refreshes every 30 seconds
- ✅ Efficient queries for large account volumes
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing data

## Dependencies

- Account management system (from PBI 2)
- Warmup process system (from Task 2-7)
- Database query optimization
- Frontend charting library (Chart.js or similar)
- Real-time data update mechanism

## Open Questions

1. What time ranges should be supported for trend analysis?
2. Should we implement real-time notifications for critical alerts?
3. What level of drill-down detail is needed for basic analytics?
4. Should we include cost tracking (proxy costs, content costs)?
5. What export formats are most useful for reporting?
