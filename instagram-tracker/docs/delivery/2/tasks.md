## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 Priority (Foundation) ✅ COMPLETE
Focus on core infrastructure that everything else depends on:
- ✅ Navigation framework
- ✅ Base DataGrid component  
- ✅ Database schema extensions
- ✅ Model Accounts Hub with tabbed interface
- ✅ Account import system with colon separator support

### Phase 2-3 Priority (Core Workflows)  
Essential account and proxy management:
- Account lifecycle state management
- Proxy assignment automation
- Import/export functionality

### Phase 4-5 Priority (User Interface)
Complete user experience:
- All specialized views
- Content management system
- Analytics and monitoring

### Phase 6-7 Priority (Advanced Features)
Platform completion:
- Bot integration APIs
- Advanced bulk operations
- Real-time collaboration

### Phase 8 Priority (Polish)
Performance and usability:
- Optimizations for large datasets
- User experience refinements
- Comprehensive testing

## Development Notes

**Current Status**: Phase 1 & Phase 2 COMPLETE! All core infrastructure and account lifecycle management implemented.

**Next Priority**: Phase 3 Features - Task 2-8 (Human Review Queue) and Tasks 2-9 through 2-11 (Proxy Management System)

**Critical Dependencies**: 
- ✅ Database schema extended and ready
- ✅ Navigation framework in place
- ✅ DataGrid component implemented
- ✅ Account import system with colon separator support
- ✅ Account lifecycle state management system
- Bot APIs are lowest priority (bot development happens after platform completion)

**Performance Considerations**:
- ✅ Virtual scrolling implemented in DataGrid
- ✅ Lifecycle state management with efficient database queries
- Real-time updates must be efficient (consider WebSocket vs polling)
- Image storage strategy needs decision early (local vs cloud)

**Bot Integration Context**:
- All bot API endpoints are for future bot development
- Platform must work standalone without bot integration
- Bot development begins only after complete platform is finished
- Focus on providing comprehensive REST APIs rather than real automation

**Recent Completions**:
- ✅ **Phase 1 & 2 Complete**: All core infrastructure and account lifecycle management implemented
- ✅ Database schema fully extended with proxy management, cost tracking, and advanced analytics
- ✅ Excel-like DataGrid component with virtual scrolling and bulk operations
- ✅ Navigation framework and tabbed Model Accounts Hub interface
- ✅ Account import system with colon-separated format (username:password:email:account_code)
- ✅ Account lifecycle state management with 7 states and transition validation
- ✅ **Complete 10-phase warmup system** with container management and bot API integration
- ✅ Central content registry and bundle management system (PBI 11)
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging and error handling throughout platform
