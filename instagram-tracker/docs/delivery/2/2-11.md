## Requirements

### Core Analytics Features
1. **Cost Tracking Dashboard**
   - Monthly cost breakdown by provider
   - Cost per account metrics
   - Budget utilization visualization
   - Historical cost trends

2. **Utilization Analytics**
   - Proxy capacity utilization charts
   - Account distribution across proxies
   - Underutilized/overutilized proxy identification
   - Efficiency metrics and recommendations

3. **Location Mapping**
   - Geographic distribution of proxies
   - Location-based performance metrics
   - Regional cost comparison
   - Interactive proxy location map

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Response time analytics
   - Connection success rates
   - Error rate tracking
   - Health monitoring dashboard

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Analytics Endpoints
1. Create proxy analytics API endpoints
2. Implement cost aggregation queries
3. Add utilization calculation functions
4. Create location-based analytics

### Phase 2: Frontend Dashboard Components
1. Create ProxyAnalyticsDashboard component
2. Build cost tracking visualizations
3. Implement utilization charts
4. Add location mapping interface

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
