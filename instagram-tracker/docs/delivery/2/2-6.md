# [2-6] Implement Bulk Operations

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive bulk operations for the DataGrid component, allowing users to select multiple accounts and perform batch edits, updates, and operations efficiently. This includes multi-selection, bulk editing panels, confirmation dialogs, and progress tracking for large operations.

## Requirements

### Multi-Selection Functionality
- **Row selection**: Click row numbers to select entire rows
- **Multi-row selection**: Ctrl+Click for non-contiguous selection
- **Range selection**: Shift+Click for contiguous range selection
- **Select all**: Ctrl+A to select all visible/filtered accounts
- **Select by criteria**: Select all accounts matching filter criteria
- **Visual indicators**: Highlight selected rows with distinct color
- **Selection counter**: Display count of selected items

### Bulk Edit Operations
- **Status changes**: Update account status for multiple accounts
- **Field updates**: Change common fields (location, content_type, etc.)
- **Relationship assignment**: Assign mother accounts to multiple slaves
- **Target user assignment**: Bulk assign target users to accounts
- **Content type categorization**: Batch update content categories
- **Location updates**: Update Stadt, Kampus, Niche for multiple accounts

### Bulk Action Interface
- **Floating action panel**: Show bulk actions when items selected
- **Quick actions**: Common operations accessible with one click
- **Advanced edit modal**: Detailed form for complex bulk edits
- **Field selection**: Choose which fields to update in bulk
- **Conditional updates**: Apply changes only to accounts meeting criteria
- **Preview changes**: Show what will be changed before confirmation

### Safety and Confirmation
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Require confirmation for destructive operations
- **Change preview**: Show exactly what will be modified
- **Undo capability**: Allow reverting bulk operations
- **Progress tracking**: Show progress for large bulk operations
- **Error handling**: Handle partial failures gracefully
- **Audit logging**: Track all bulk operations for compliance

### Performance and Scalability
- **Batch API calls**: Efficient server-side bulk processing
- **Progress indicators**: Real-time progress for large operations
- **Background processing**: Handle large operations asynchronously
- **Optimistic updates**: Update UI immediately, sync in background
- **Error recovery**: Retry failed operations automatically

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Selection System
1. Enhance DataGrid with multi-selection state management
2. Add row selection UI with checkboxes and row number clicks
3. Implement keyboard shortcuts for selection (Ctrl+A, Shift+Click)
4. Create selection visual indicators and counter
5. Add select-by-criteria functionality

### Phase 2: Bulk Action Interface
1. Create floating bulk action panel component
2. Build quick action buttons for common operations
3. Design bulk edit modal with field selection
4. Add preview functionality to show pending changes
5. Implement conditional bulk updates

### Phase 3: Safety and Confirmation
1. Build confirmation dialog system
2. Add change preview with before/after comparison
3. Implement undo functionality for bulk operations
4. Create comprehensive error handling
5. Add audit logging for compliance

### Phase 4: Backend API Integration
1. Create bulk update API endpoints
2. Implement batch processing with progress tracking
3. Add background job processing for large operations
4. Build error recovery and retry mechanisms
5. Optimize database queries for bulk operations

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization
1. Implement optimistic updates for immediate feedback
2. Add progress tracking for long-running operations
3. Optimize for large selection sets (1000+ accounts)
4. Add cancellation support for bulk operations
5. Performance testing and optimization

## Test Plan

### Selection Testing
- Test single row selection with visual feedback
- Verify multi-selection with Ctrl+Click works correctly
- Check range selection with Shift+Click functions properly
- Test select-all functionality with large datasets
- Validate selection state persists during scrolling

### Bulk Operation Testing
- Test each bulk operation type (status, fields, relationships)
- Verify bulk edit modal shows correct field options
- Check preview functionality displays accurate changes
- Test conditional updates apply correctly
- Validate progress tracking for large operations

### Safety and Error Handling
- Test confirmation dialogs prevent accidental operations
- Verify undo functionality works correctly
- Check error handling for partial operation failures
- Test audit logging captures all bulk operations
- Validate rollback capabilities work properly

### Performance Testing
- Test bulk operations with increasing dataset sizes (100, 1k, 10k)
- Verify UI remains responsive during bulk processing
- Check memory usage during large selections
- Test API performance for batch operations
- Validate background processing doesn't block UI

### Integration Testing
- Test bulk operations work with filtered datasets
- Verify integration with inline editing features
- Check compatibility with column management
- Test bulk operations with dynamic columns
- Validate export functionality includes bulk selections

## Verification

- [ ] Multi-selection works correctly with visual feedback
- [ ] Bulk edit operations update accounts accurately
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental changes
- [ ] Progress tracking works for large operations
- [ ] Error handling manages partial failures gracefully
- [ ] Undo functionality restores previous state correctly
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable with large selections
- [ ] Audit logging captures all bulk operations
- [ ] API efficiently handles batch processing
- [ ] UI remains responsive during bulk operations
