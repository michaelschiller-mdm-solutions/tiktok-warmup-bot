# PBI-11: Central Content Registry and Bundle Management

## Overview
A comprehensive central content registry system that allows campaign managers to efficiently organize, manage, and reuse content across multiple models and campaigns through an advanced bundle management system with batch operations.

## Problem Statement
Campaign managers need a centralized system to manage content that can be shared across multiple models and campaigns. The existing model-specific content management lacks:
- Cross-model content sharing capabilities
- Efficient batch operations for content assignment
- Organized content bundling for different campaign types
- Centralized content library with advanced categorization
- Streamlined content upload with per-file customization

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a campaign manager, I want a central content registry with bundle management so that I can efficiently organize, assign, and reuse content across multiple models and campaigns**

### Supporting User Stories
1. **As a campaign manager, I want to upload content to a central registry with per-file categorization so that I can organize content efficiently during upload**
2. **As a campaign manager, I want to create content bundles with mixed media so that I can group related content for specific campaign types**
3. **As a campaign manager, I want to batch assign content to multiple bundles so that I can efficiently organize large amounts of content**
4. **As a campaign manager, I want to view and edit bundle contents so that I can manage content assignments and remove items as needed**
5. **As a campaign manager, I want to select bundles for model content so that I can reuse organized content across different campaigns**

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Central Content Registry
- **Location**: `/content` route with dedicated interface
- **Components**: 
  - `CentralContentRegistry` - Main interface with tabbed navigation
  - `CentralContentUploadModal` - Enhanced upload with per-file settings
  - `BundleCreateModal` - Bundle creation and editing
  - `BundleContentsModal` - Bundle content management
  - `BatchAssignModal` - Batch assignment operations

#### 2. Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Central content storage
CREATE TABLE central_content (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    original_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (content_type IN ('image', 'video')),
    file_size INTEGER,
    categories JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    tags JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Central text content
CREATE TABLE central_text_content (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    text_content TEXT NOT NULL,
    categories JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    tags JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    template_name VARCHAR(255),
    language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en',
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Content bundles
CREATE TABLE content_bundles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    bundle_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'mixed',
    categories JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    tags JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Bundle assignments (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE bundle_content_assignments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    bundle_id INTEGER REFERENCES content_bundles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    content_id INTEGER REFERENCES central_content(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    text_content_id INTEGER REFERENCES central_text_content(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    assignment_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CHECK (content_id IS NOT NULL OR text_content_id IS NOT NULL)
);
```

#### 3. API Endpoints
```typescript
// Content Management
GET    /api/central/content                    // List all content
POST   /api/central/content/upload            // Upload new content
PUT    /api/central/content/:id               // Update content
DELETE /api/central/content/:id               // Delete content

// Text Content Management  
GET    /api/central/text-content              // List all text content
POST   /api/central/text-content              // Create text content
PUT    /api/central/text-content/:id          // Update text content
DELETE /api/central/text-content/:id          // Delete text content

// Bundle Management
GET    /api/central/bundles                   // List all bundles
POST   /api/central/bundles                   // Create bundle
PUT    /api/central/bundles/:id               // Update bundle
DELETE /api/central/bundles/:id               // Delete bundle
GET    /api/central/bundles/:id/contents      // Get bundle contents

// Bundle Assignment Operations
POST   /api/central/bundles/:id/add-content           // Add single item
POST   /api/central/bundles/:id/add-content/batch     // Batch add items
DELETE /api/central/bundles/:id/content/:assignmentId // Remove item

// Model Integration
GET    /api/central/models/:id/bundles        // Get bundles for model selection
```

## UX/UI Considerations

### Navigation Integration
- **Primary Access**: "Content Registry" link in main navigation sidebar
- **Secondary Access**: "Manage Bundles" button in model content management
- **Visual Identity**: Package icon (ðŸ“¦) for bundle-related features

### Interface Design Principles

#### 1. Tabbed Organization
```typescript
interface TabStructure {
  'content': 'Content Library',    // Individual content management
  'bundles': 'Content Bundles',    // Bundle management
  'texts': 'Text Library'          // Text content management
}
```

#### 2. Selection and Batch Operations
- **Selection Mode**: Toggle-able selection interface with checkboxes
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected items highlighted with blue ring and background
- **Batch Actions**: Contextual action bar appears when items selected
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time assignment results with success/error indicators

#### 3. Upload Experience
- **Split Panel Layout**: Global settings (left) + individual file management (right)
- **Per-File Customization**: Each file can have unique categories, tags, and bundle assignments
- **Visual Preview**: Thumbnail previews with status indicators
- **Drag & Drop**: Enhanced drag and drop with visual feedback

#### 4. Bundle Management
- **Bundle Cards**: Visual cards showing bundle type, content counts, and categories
- **Content Preview**: Modal showing all bundle contents with management options
- **Quick Actions**: Edit, view contents, and delete actions on each bundle card
