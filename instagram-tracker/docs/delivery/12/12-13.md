# [12-13] Highlight Maintenance Tracking and Monitoring System

## Description

Implement a comprehensive tracking and monitoring system for Instagram highlight maintenance that works with the iPhone bot infrastructure. This system will track scheduled content assignments, monitor bot upload progress, maintain account state awareness, and provide real-time visibility into highlight maintenance activities across all accounts. The iPhone bot handles actual uploads; this system tracks what has been done and what's pending.
