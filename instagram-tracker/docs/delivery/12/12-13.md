# [12-13] Automatic Maintenance System for Highlights

## Description

Implement a comprehensive background automation system for Instagram highlight maintenance that operates independently of user intervention. This system will automatically execute scheduled maintenance operations, detect and resolve conflicts, manage content rotation, and ensure highlight groups maintain their optimal positioning and content freshness according to their configured schedules.
