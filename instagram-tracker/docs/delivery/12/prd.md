# PBI-12: Advanced Content Sprint Management System

## Overview

This PBI introduces a sophisticated content management system that simulates realistic social media behavior through content sprints, highlight management, and intelligent content scheduling. The system moves beyond basic content pools to create authentic, timeline-based content workflows that mimic real user behavior patterns.

## Problem Statement

The current Instagram Tracker has a sophisticated 10-phase warmup system for new accounts. However, once accounts complete their warmup phases, they lack a structured content management system for ongoing authentic posting behavior. Post-warmup accounts need sophisticated content management to simulate realistic long-term social media patterns that authentic Instagram users exhibit.

Real Instagram users don't post randomly after establishment - they have patterns, themes, locations, and timing that reflect their life activities (vacations, university periods, home life, etc.). 

To create authentic post-warmup account behavior at scale, we need a system that:
- Simulates realistic content workflows for established accounts (vacation trips, daily life, special events)
- Manages content timing with realistic delays between posts
- Handles location-based content restrictions
- Manages Instagram highlights with long-term maintenance
- Provides emergency content capabilities
- Prevents impossible content combinations (can't be in Jamaica and Germany simultaneously)
- Works seamlessly alongside the existing warmup system for different account lifecycle stages

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a Campaign Manager**, I want to create and manage sophisticated content sprints and highlight groups so that my Instagram accounts post content with realistic human-like patterns and timing.

### Supporting User Stories

1. **Sprint Creation**: As a Campaign Manager, I want to create content sprints with specific themes, locations, and timing rules so that accounts appear to live authentic experiences.

2. **Highlight Management**: As a Campaign Manager, I want to manage long-term highlight groups that build organically over time so that account profiles look established and authentic.

3. **Content Scheduling**: As a Campaign Manager, I want the system to automatically schedule content with realistic delays and prevent conflicting content so that posting patterns appear natural.

4. **Emergency Content**: As a Campaign Manager, I want to inject emergency content that interrupts normal scheduling so that I can respond to real-time events or opportunities.

5. **Campaign Assignment**: As a Campaign Manager, I want to assign combinations of sprints to accounts automatically while respecting blocking rules so that I can manage hundreds of accounts efficiently.

6. **Visual Timeline Management**: As a Campaign Manager, I want to see Gantt chart visualizations of content schedules per account so that I can understand and manage complex content timelines.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Overview

The system extends the existing Model → Account structure with sophisticated content workflow management for **post-warmup accounts**. This works alongside the existing 10-phase warmup system, activating only after accounts have completed their warmup:

```
Models (Instagram Profiles)
├── Accounts (Individual Instagram accounts per model)
│   ├── Account Sprints (Assigned sprint instances)
│   ├── Account State (Current location, active sprints, queued content)
│   └── Content Queue (Upcoming posts with realistic timestamps)
├── Content Sprints (User-created content workflows)
│   ├── Sprint Content Items (Images with metadata)
│   ├── Sprint Rules (duration, delays, blocks, location, seasonality)
│   ├── Sprint Categories (story, post, highlight assignments)
│   └── After-Sprint Content (transition content)
├── Highlight Groups (Long-term content maintenance)
│   ├── Highlight Content Pool (up to 100 images)
│   ├── Highlight Maintenance Rules (timing, blocking)
│   └── Highlight Position Management (dynamic reordering)
└── Campaign Pools (Collections of compatible sprints for assignment)
```

### Core Concepts

#### Content Sprints
**Definition**: Time-bound, thematic content workflows that simulate specific life experiences.

**Characteristics**:
- **Theme-based**: Vacation, University, Home, Work, Fitness, etc.
- **Location-aware**: Jamaica, Germany, University Campus, Home
- **Time-bound**: Duration calculated from cumulative content delays
- **Restrictive**: Block conflicting content (can't be home during vacation)
- **Seasonal**: Can be restricted to specific months
- **Structured**: Ordered content with realistic posting delays

**Example Sprint**: "Jamaica Vacation"
- Duration: 7-14 days (calculated from content delays)
- Content: 15 beach/sunset/vacation images
- Posting: Every 1-3 days with random delays
- Location: Jamaica
- Blocks: ["Germany Home", "University Content", "Work Content"]
- Months: Available April-October (vacation season)
- After-Sprint: Airport/dog-at-home transition content

#### Campaign Pools (Content Collections)
**Definition**: Collections of actual content (images/videos) organized by Instagram posting format.

**Types**:

**Story Pools**:
- Collection of images/videos for Instagram Stories
- 24-hour temporary content with immediate posting
- Option to add individual pictures to existing highlight groups
- User controls which stories transition to highlights

**Post Pools**:
- Collections of up to 20 pictures per pool
- Can be configured as single-image or multi-image posts (1-8 images per post)
- User specifies image groupings for multi-image posts
- Option to add selected pictures to existing highlight groups
- User selects which highlight groups receive the content

**Highlight Pools (Groups)**:
- Long-term content collections for Instagram highlight sections
- **Content Organization**: Chronological order (user-defined) OR Random order
- **Timing Control** (Chronological Order Only): 
  - Default delay between uploads (applies to all content in chronological sequence)
  - Per-picture custom delays (individual timing control overriding default)
  - Random order bypasses timing controls (immediate or system-determined scheduling)
- **Caption Management**: Single caption for the entire highlight group (pushed to Instagram)
- **Content Format Control**: Configure individual items as story-only OR post + story
- **Batch Upload System**: Content uploaded in batches of up to 20 items per batch
- **Position Management**: Dynamic highlight positioning (newest highlights = position 1)

#### Highlight Groups
**Definition**: Long-term content collections that build Instagram highlight sections over months/years.

**Characteristics**:
- **Maintenance-based**: Add 1-2 images every 2-4 weeks
- **Less restrictive**: Can be posted "whenever" (when not blocked)
- **Position-managed**: Dynamic reordering (newest highlights = position 1)
- **Seasonal batches**: Different content available by month
- **Blocking rules**: Can block other highlights and be blocked by sprints
- **Large content pools**: Up to 100 images per group
- **Warmup Integration**: Accounts completing warmup have their existing highlight preserved at appropriate position

**Example Highlight Group**: "Travel Memories"
- Content Pool: 100 travel images
- Maintenance: Add 1-2 images every 3 weeks
- Position: Dynamic (newest highlights appear first)
- Blocks: ["Work Highlights"] during maintenance
- Blocked by: ["Vacation Sprints"] (pause during active travel)
- Seasonal: Different batches for summer/winter content

#### Content Categories
Each content item can be assigned multiple Instagram formats:

**Story**: 24-hour temporary content
- Can auto-move to highlights after 24 hours
- User controls story → highlight transition
- Immediate posting

**Post**: Permanent feed content
- Can be single image or multi-image groups (1-8 images)
- User specifies image groupings
- Delayed posting with realistic timing

**Highlight**: Long-term profile sections
- Built from stories over time
- Position-managed (newest = position 1)
- Maintained through automation

#### Location Management
**Current Location Logic**:
- Account location = Active sprint location
- Default location: "Home"
- Location conflicts prevented (can't be in Jamaica + Germany)
- Idle periods: Return to "Home" location
- Emergency content: Can override location restrictions with warnings

### Content Workflow System

#### Sprint Assignment Process

1. **Sprint Creation**:
   - User uploads 15-20 images with captions
   - User sets sprint rules (location, blocks, seasonality)
   - User defines content categories per image
   - User specifies posting delays and duration parameters

2. **Campaign Pool Creation**:
   - Multiple compatible sprints combined into campaigns
   - System validates no blocking conflicts between sprints
   - Campaigns become assignable units for accounts

3. **Account Assignment**:
   - Pure random assignment from non-conflicting campaigns
   - Balanced distribution preferred but not strict
   - User can override: assign to specific number of accounts or "all accounts"
   - Pre-validation warns if insufficient non-conflicting content exists

4. **Content Scheduling**:
   - System generates realistic timestamps based on delays
   - Content queued with account-specific timing
   - Conflicts detected and resolved according to rules

#### Highlight Maintenance System

1. **Group Creation**:
   - User uploads content pool (up to 100 images)
   - User sets maintenance schedule (frequency, timing)
   - User defines blocking rules and seasonal restrictions

2. **Position Management**:
   - New highlights always get position 1
   - Existing highlights increment position by 1
   - Dynamic reordering maintains Instagram-like behavior

3. **Maintenance Automation**:
   - System randomly selects 1-2 images every few weeks
   - Maintenance pauses during conflicting sprints
   - Content blocked if used in active vacation sprints

#### Emergency Content System

**Immediate Interrupt Capability**:
- Emergency content can be injected at any time
- User chooses: pause current sprints OR post alongside
- Conflict handling: skip conflicted accounts OR override warnings
- No category restrictions (can be story, post, or highlight)
- Cooldown adjustment: sprint cooldowns extended by emergency duration
