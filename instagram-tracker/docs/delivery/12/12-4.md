## Technical Implementation

### Database Extensions

The campaign pool system will use the existing `campaign_pools` table from Task 12-1:

```sql
-- Extend campaign_pools with additional fields
ALTER TABLE campaign_pools 
ADD COLUMN assignment_strategy VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'random',
ADD COLUMN time_horizon_days INTEGER DEFAULT 30,
ADD COLUMN is_template BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN template_category VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN last_assigned TIMESTAMP;

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_campaign_pools_strategy ON campaign_pools(assignment_strategy);
CREATE INDEX idx_campaign_pools_template ON campaign_pools(is_template) WHERE is_template = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_campaign_pools_category ON campaign_pools(template_category) WHERE template_category IS NOT NULL;
```

### Type Definitions

```typescript
export interface CampaignPool {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  sprint_ids: number[];
  total_duration_hours: number;
  compatible_accounts: number;
  assignment_strategy: 'random' | 'balanced' | 'manual';
  time_horizon_days: number;
  is_template: boolean;
  template_category?: string;
  usage_count: number;
  last_assigned?: Date;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}

export interface CreatePoolRequest {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  sprint_ids: number[];
  assignment_strategy?: 'random' | 'balanced' | 'manual';
  time_horizon_days?: number;
}

export interface CompatibilityReport {
  is_compatible: boolean;
  blocking_conflicts: Conflict[];
  seasonal_issues: SeasonalIssue[];
  duration_warnings: DurationWarning[];
  account_eligibility_count: number;
}

export interface AssignmentOptions {
  strategy: 'random' | 'balanced' | 'manual';
  account_ids?: number[];
  max_assignments?: number;
  start_date?: Date;
  respect_cooldowns: boolean;
}

export interface AssignmentResult {
  successful_assignments: Assignment[];
  failed_assignments: FailedAssignment[];
  total_accounts_assigned: number;
  conflicts_resolved: number;
  warnings: Warning[];
}
```

### Core Business Logic

#### Compatibility Validation

```typescript
class PoolValidationService {
  async validateSprintCompatibility(sprintIds: number[]): Promise<CompatibilityReport> {
    // Check blocking relationships
    const sprints = await this.getSprintsById(sprintIds);
    const conflicts = this.detectBlockingConflicts(sprints);
    
    // Validate seasonal compatibility
    const seasonalIssues = this.checkSeasonalCompatibility(sprints);
    
    // Calculate duration warnings
    const durationWarnings = this.analyzeDurationConstraints(sprints);
    
    // Count eligible accounts
    const eligibleAccounts = await this.countEligibleAccounts(sprintIds);
    
    return {
      is_compatible: conflicts.length === 0 && seasonalIssues.length === 0,
      blocking_conflicts: conflicts,
      seasonal_issues: seasonalIssues,
      duration_warnings: durationWarnings,
      account_eligibility_count: eligibleAccounts
    };
  }

  private detectBlockingConflicts(sprints: Sprint[]): Conflict[] {
    const conflicts: Conflict[] = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < sprints.length; i++) {
      for (let j = i + 1; j < sprints.length; j++) {
        const sprintA = sprints[i];
        const sprintB = sprints[j];
        
        // Check if A blocks B or B blocks A
        if (sprintA.blocks_sprints.includes(sprintB.id)) {
          conflicts.push({
            type: 'blocking_conflict',
            sprint_a: sprintA.id,
            sprint_b: sprintB.id,
            description: `${sprintA.name} blocks ${sprintB.name}`
          });
        }
        
        if (sprintB.blocks_sprints.includes(sprintA.id)) {
          conflicts.push({
            type: 'blocking_conflict',
            sprint_a: sprintB.id,
            sprint_b: sprintA.id,
            description: `${sprintB.name} blocks ${sprintA.name}`
          });
        }
      }
    }
    
    return conflicts;
  }
}
```

#### Assignment Logic

```typescript
class PoolAssignmentService {
  async assignPoolToAccounts(poolId: number, options: AssignmentOptions): Promise<AssignmentResult> {
    const pool = await this.campaignPoolService.getPool(poolId);
    let targetAccounts: Account[];
    
    // Determine target accounts based on strategy
    if (options.strategy === 'manual' && options.account_ids) {
      targetAccounts = await this.getAccountsByIds(options.account_ids);
    } else {
      targetAccounts = await this.getCompatibleAccounts(poolId);
    }
    
    // Apply assignment strategy
    const assignments = await this.executeAssignmentStrategy(
      pool, 
      targetAccounts, 
      options
    );
    
    // Process assignments with conflict resolution
    const result = await this.processAssignments(assignments);
    
    // Update pool usage statistics
    await this.updatePoolUsage(poolId, result);
    
    return result;
  }

  private async executeAssignmentStrategy(
    pool: CampaignPool,
    accounts: Account[],
    options: AssignmentOptions
  ): Promise<PendingAssignment[]> {
    switch (options.strategy) {
      case 'random':
        return this.randomAssignment(pool, accounts, options);
      case 'balanced':
        return this.balancedAssignment(pool, accounts, options);
      case 'manual':
        return this.manualAssignment(pool, accounts, options);
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unknown assignment strategy: ${options.strategy}`);
    }
  }

  private randomAssignment(
    pool: CampaignPool,
    accounts: Account[],
    options: AssignmentOptions
  ): PendingAssignment[] {
    const shuffled = [...accounts].sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
    const maxAssignments = options.max_assignments || accounts.length;
    const selected = shuffled.slice(0, maxAssignments);
    
    return selected.map(account => ({
      account_id: account.id,
      pool_id: pool.id,
      sprint_ids: pool.sprint_ids,
      start_date: options.start_date || new Date(),
      strategy_used: 'random'
    }));
  }

  private balancedAssignment(
    pool: CampaignPool,
    accounts: Account[],
    options: AssignmentOptions
  ): PendingAssignment[] {
    // Sort accounts by current assignment count (ascending)
    const sortedAccounts = accounts.sort((a, b) => 
      a.current_assignments - b.current_assignments
    );
    
    const maxAssignments = options.max_assignments || accounts.length;
    const selected = sortedAccounts.slice(0, maxAssignments);
    
    return selected.map(account => ({
      account_id: account.id,
      pool_id: pool.id,
      sprint_ids: pool.sprint_ids,
      start_date: options.start_date || new Date(),
      strategy_used: 'balanced'
    }));
  }
}
```
