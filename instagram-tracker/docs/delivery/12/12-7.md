# [12-7] Content Queue Generation and Management

## Description

Implement comprehensive content queue management system with monitoring, control capabilities, and real-time updates. This task builds on the basic queue generation in Task 12-6 to provide full lifecycle management of content queues including monitoring, pausing, resuming, rescheduling, and emergency content integration.

## Requirements

### Core Queue Management Features

1. **Queue Monitoring API Endpoints**:
   - List all queue items with filtering and pagination
   - Get queue for specific account
   - Get upcoming content across all accounts
   - Get overdue content items requiring attention
   - Queue statistics and health metrics
   - Queue health report with bottleneck detection
   - Queue summary for dashboard

2. **Queue Control Operations**:
   - Reschedule content items to new times
   - Retry failed content items with exponential backoff
   - Remove items from queue with proper cleanup
   - Bulk update multiple queue items
   - Cancel all queued items for an account
   - Pause/resume sprint queues
   - Clean up old completed/failed queue items

3. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Overall queue health status (healthy/warning/critical)
   - Processing metrics and success rates
   - Bottleneck detection (high queue size, failed items, overdue content)
   - Alert generation for critical issues
   - Performance metrics tracking

4. **Emergency Content Support**:
   - Priority insertion of emergency content
   - Strategy-based content placement
   - Conflict resolution with existing queues

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Services ✅
- [x] **QueueManagementService**: Comprehensive query and monitoring capabilities
- [x] **QueueControlService**: Operations for modifying and controlling queue items
- [x] **Type Definitions**: Complete type system for queue operations

### Phase 2: API Endpoints ✅
- [x] **Monitoring Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/content-queue` - List queue items with filtering
  - `GET /api/content-queue/account/:id` - Account-specific queue
  - `GET /api/content-queue/upcoming` - Upcoming content
  - `GET /api/content-queue/overdue` - Overdue items
  - `GET /api/content-queue/stats` - Queue statistics
  - `GET /api/content-queue/health` - Health report
  - `GET /api/content-queue/summary` - Dashboard summary

- [x] **Control Endpoints**:
  - `PUT /api/content-queue/:id/reschedule` - Reschedule item
  - `POST /api/content-queue/:id/retry` - Retry failed item
  - `DELETE /api/content-queue/:id` - Remove from queue
  - `PUT /api/content-queue/bulk-update` - Bulk operations
  - `POST /api/content-queue/emergency-insert` - Emergency content
  - `POST /api/content-queue/cleanup` - Cleanup old items

### Phase 3: Integration ✅
- [x] **Route Registration**: Added to main app with `/api/content-queue` prefix
- [x] **Service Integration**: Connected to existing ContentQueueService from Task 12-6
- [x] **Type System**: Extended queue types for management operations

## Verification

### Functional Testing
- [x] **API Endpoints**: All endpoints accessible and returning proper responses
- [x] **Service Methods**: Core management and control operations implemented
- [x] **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error responses
- [x] **Integration**: Routes registered in main application

### Data Integrity
- [x] **Transaction Safety**: All critical operations use database transactions
- [x] **Validation**: Input validation for all control operations
- [x] **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of related data when removing items

### Performance
- [x] **Query Optimization**: Efficient filtering and pagination
- [x] **Bulk Operations**: Support for batch updates
- [x] **Health Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and bottleneck detection

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
- **`src/services/QueueManagementService.ts`**: Core monitoring and query service
- **`src/services/QueueControlService.ts`**: Control operations for queue manipulation
- **`src/routes/contentQueue.ts`**: Complete API endpoints for queue management

### Modified Files
- **`src/index.ts`**: Added content queue routes registration
- **`src/types/queue.ts`**: Extended with management-specific types

## Implementation Summary

### QueueManagementService Features
