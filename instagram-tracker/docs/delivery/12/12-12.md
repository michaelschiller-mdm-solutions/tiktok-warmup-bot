# [12-12] Highlight Group Configuration Interface

## Description

Create a sophisticated React-based interface for highlight group setup, maintenance scheduling, and position management. This interface will allow content managers to configure Instagram highlight groups as special content pools that maintain themselves over time with automated content addition and intelligent position management.
