   - Duplicate model settings

2. **Bulk Operations**:
   - Multi-select functionality
   - Bulk status changes
   - Bulk delete with confirmation

   - Confirmation requirements
   - Undo capabilities where possible

4. **Action Feedback**:
   - Progress indicators
   - Success/error notifications
   - Action history logging
   - Rollback options

## Implementation Plan

1. **Action Components**: Confirmation dialogs and action buttons
2. **State Management**: Multi-select and bulk operations
3. **API Integration**: Batch operations support
4. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications and progress indicators

## Verification
