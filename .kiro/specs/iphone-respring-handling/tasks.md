# Implementation Plan - Simplified Approach

- [x] 1. Add respring handling to send-to-iphone.js
  - Modified nuclear cleaner flow to wait 15 seconds after respring
  - Added wake_up.lua execution after the wait period
  - Added additional 5-second wait for iPhone to be fully ready
  - Updated both TypeScript source and compiled JavaScript versions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Add respring handling to warmupContentAssignment.ts route
  - Updated API route to include same respring handling logic
  - Ensures consistent behavior whether called via script or API
  - Added proper error handling for wake-up script failures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Create test script for respring handling
  - Created test-respring-handling.js to validate the fix
  - Tests complete flow: nuclear cleaner → wait → wake_up.lua → verification
  - Includes iPhone responsiveness testing after wake-up
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ] 4. Test the implementation with real automation
  - Run test-respring-handling.js to verify basic functionality
  - Test with actual warmup phases that use nuclear cleaner
  - Monitor logs to ensure tasks complete properly (not marked as completed prematurely)
  - Verify automation continues normally after respring handling
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Add optional respring event logging (if needed)
  - Add simple logging when respring handling is triggered
  - Track frequency of resprings for monitoring purposes
  - Log successful wake-up completions vs failures
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3_

## Key Changes Made

### Nuclear Cleaner Flow (Before)

1. Nuclear cleaner runs → iPhone resprings
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Continue with automation → **FAILS** (iPhone still respringing)

### Nuclear Cleaner Flow (After)

1. Nuclear cleaner runs → iPhone resprings
2. Wait 15 seconds for respring to complete
3. Execute wake_up.lua script (with retries)
4. Wait additional 5 seconds for iPhone to be fully ready
5. Continue with automation → **WORKS** (iPhone is responsive)
