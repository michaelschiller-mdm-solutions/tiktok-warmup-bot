# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a standalone Chrome extension that automates Instagram follow/unfollow operations with advanced anti-bot detection capabilities. The extension will process CSV/TXT files containing account names, implement progressive daily limits, and use human-like interaction patterns to avoid detection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a social media manager, I want to upload a CSV/TXT file with Instagram account names, so that I can automate following and unfollowing operations at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the upload button THEN the system SHALL accept CSV and TXT file formats
2. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL parse account names from the file content
3. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating the issue
4. WHEN the file is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL display the total number of accounts loaded
5. IF the file contains invalid account names THEN the system SHALL skip invalid entries and log them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user concerned about bot detection, I want the extension to implement human-like behavior patterns, so that my Instagram account remains safe from automated detection systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing in search fields THEN the system SHALL implement variable typing speeds between 80-200ms per character
2. WHEN typing THEN the system SHALL occasionally make typos and correct them to simulate human behavior
3. WHEN navigating between actions THEN the system SHALL implement random delays between 2-8 seconds
4. WHEN clicking buttons THEN the system SHALL add random mouse movement patterns before clicking
5. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL vary interaction patterns to avoid predictable behavior
6. WHEN encountering rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with random jitter

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a campaign manager, I want to configure progressive daily follow limits, so that I can gradually increase activity to build account credibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring daily limits THEN the system SHALL allow setting different limits for each day
2. WHEN the daily limit is reached THEN the system SHALL stop following and resume the next day
3. WHEN setting progressive limits THEN the system SHALL support patterns like "10 day 1, 20 day 2, 30 day 3"
4. WHEN limits are configured THEN the system SHALL persist settings across browser sessions
5. IF no limits are set THEN the system SHALL default to conservative limits (5 follows per day)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple campaigns, I want a sidebar interface with clear status indicators, so that I can monitor and control the automation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar interface on Instagram pages
2. WHEN automation is running THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress indicators
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages in the sidebar
4. WHEN the user wants to stop THEN the system SHALL provide an emergency stop button
5. WHEN viewing status THEN the system SHALL show daily progress, remaining accounts, and next action time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user wanting to maintain authentic engagement, I want the system to automatically unfollow accounts after a configurable period, so that I can manage my following ratio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an account is followed THEN the system SHALL record the follow timestamp
2. WHEN the unfollow period expires THEN the system SHALL queue the account for unfollowing
3. WHEN configuring unfollow timing THEN the system SHALL allow setting delays between 1-30 days
4. WHEN unfollowing THEN the system SHALL use the same anti-detection patterns as following
5. IF an account follows back THEN the system SHALL optionally skip unfollowing based on user settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user concerned about Instagram's detection systems, I want the extension to implement advanced evasion techniques, so that my automation remains undetected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL rotate user agents and browser fingerprints
2. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL implement request header randomization
3. WHEN detected by rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent cooldown periods
4. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic browsing patterns including scrolling and pausing
5. WHEN following accounts THEN the system SHALL occasionally view profiles and posts before following
6. WHEN operating THEN the system SHALL respect Instagram's daily and hourly action limits

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user managing automation campaigns, I want comprehensive logging and analytics, so that I can track performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN actions are performed THEN the system SHALL log all follow/unfollow operations with timestamps
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display success rates, daily totals, and error statistics
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow downloading logs in CSV format
5. IF storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate old logs

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user operating the extension, I want intelligent queue management, so that the system efficiently processes accounts while maintaining safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accounts are loaded THEN the system SHALL create separate queues for follow and unfollow operations
2. WHEN processing queues THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on configured schedules and limits
3. WHEN accounts are already followed THEN the system SHALL skip duplicate follow attempts
4. WHEN Instagram pages change THEN the system SHALL adapt to new selectors and layouts
5. IF queue processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
